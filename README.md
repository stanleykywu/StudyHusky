Finding rooms to study in at Northeastern is difficult during finals/midterms. This webpage allows remote access of live data of which rooms are occupied/free

- React and javascript
- Allows users to pick room and occupy it
- Used firebase databse to store different classrooms and their occupancy/capacity
- Used javascript to send/get data from firebase (using snap and val)
